# Foxox's Tribes 2 Scripts
Here are some of my Tribes 2 game scripts or scripts I have tweaked/fixed/updated.

Each script has a separate directory in this repository.

Also check out deploy.py, which is a little tool to help iterate on VL2 projects. You put your script, textures, sounds, skins, mission, etc. in a directory outside of your GameData/base directory (anywhere you want... such as a git repository folder!), run deploy.py in there, and it will bundle up your project into a vl2 and put it into your GameData/base directory for you, replacing whatever version was in there previously. This is especially helpful for projects that are made up of multiple files. Test it in game, then share the VL2 file with your friends.
